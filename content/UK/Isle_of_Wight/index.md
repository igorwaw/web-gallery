description: I lived on the Isle of Wight in 2022 and 2023. It's the most unusual part of the UK. An important tourist destination for most of 19th and 20th century, now it's a shadow of it's former glory, but still attracts visitors. Also the place where hovercrafts and space rockets were built, and were some unscathed nature still remains.

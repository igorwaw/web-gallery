linktitle: Kalisz
description: The oldest Polish town, it existed 2000 years ago and traded with ancient Rome. Also the place where I spent my childhood - though I obviously couldn't have a digital camera, so the photos are mostly from the early 2000s. I also included photos from Gołuchów - a village about 15km from Kalisz, known for a Renaissance castle hosting a world-class collection of paintings and ancient artifacts, and for a wildlife reserve, breeding rare species such as European Bison.

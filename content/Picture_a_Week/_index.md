description: A long long time ago (I think it was 2005) I stumbled upon the idea of Picture a Day. People had a resolution to make one creative, well thought photo everyday and post it on the web. It was clear to see they really improved their skills with such project. I liked the idea, but I never had time for such undertaking. It's not about just snapping a picture, it's about trying different techniques and styles, experimenting with the composition, sometimes setting up lights and props. In 2020 I came back to the idea, but changed it to Picture a Week. That should be more doable.

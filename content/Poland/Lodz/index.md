linktitle: Lodz
description: Lodz, or rather Łódź, was a centre of textile manufacturing since the 19th century. It suffered massively with a deindustrialization of Europe in 1990s, but reinvented itself in the 21st century. My roots are from Łódź, but my family moved away and I returned for my early adult years. Unfortunately only at the end I got a digital camera, so I don't have much photos - definitely less than this city deserve.

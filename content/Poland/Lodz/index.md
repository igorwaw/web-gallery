linktitle: Lodz
description: Lodz, or rather Łódź, was a centre of textile manufacturing since the 19th century. It suffered massively with a deindustrialization of Europe in 1990s, but reinvented itself in the 21st century. My roots are from Łódź, my family then moved away, but I returned for my teen and early adult years.

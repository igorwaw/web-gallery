description: Sorry for putting all of Scotland into one gallery, but so far I've only been there once. It was in 2003, on a sailing trip from Amsterdam to Edinburgh. We also visited Eyemouth (and some English cities) and took a bus trip to the Highlands. At that time I used a film camera and I only have low quality scans.

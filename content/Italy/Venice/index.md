linktitle: Venice
description: One of my favourite places. Just like in Prague, I can tolerate the crowds if that's the price to pay. My first trip abroad as a 12 year old was to Venice, I later visited it several times on my way to some other place. The pictures are from one of those occasions - I was flying and the connection was through Venice airport, I took the opportunity to see the city.

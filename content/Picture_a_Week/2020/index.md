title: Picture a Week 2020
linktitle: paw2020
description: My first Picture a Week. Results were mixed. First weeks went fine, I tried different subjects. Then came the lockdown, which meant not only less subjects, but also very little time - I saved minutes on commute, but spent hours on organizing education and entertainment for my child. I posted way too much birds and insects because they were the easiest to get. Autumn was even worse, I got busy and some weeks I didn't even take a single photo, let alone a good one. Still, at least some of the time I tried something new and I feel I improved a bit.

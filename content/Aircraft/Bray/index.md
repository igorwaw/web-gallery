title: Bray Airshow 2005
linktitle: Bray
description: In 2005 when I lived in Ireland, there was a free airshow just a few trainstops from me. I wish a had a better camera! Not a huge show - just some aircraft from the Irish military and a few aerobatics teams - but a great location, over sea and mountains.

description: In 2005, when I lived in Dublin, I made a weekend trip to Belfast. It made a huge, if not always positive impression on me. Several years after the violence subsided, you could still see the marks it left. Barbwire everywhere, schools looked like prisons and police stations looked like fortresses. Murals praising terrorists from both sides - although some peaceful murals began to appear.

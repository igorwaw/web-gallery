title: Shuttleworth Collection airshows
linktitle: Shuttleworth
description: Shuttleworth Collection is an air museum, notable for having most of their exhibits (some over a 100 years old) in a working order. They host airshows with own and visiting aircraft - I visited two - but even on a regular day you can often see their planes in the air. The airshows mostly focus on historic planes, but sometimes there's a visit from RAF.

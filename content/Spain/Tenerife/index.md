description: That was an unusal vacation in winter 2023. I went there instead of someone who couldn't and had non-refundable reservation. It was fun. Not too hot, and the views around the Teide volcano were out of this world. Unfortunately I couldn't see the volcano up close (cancelled due to strong wind) and the astronomical observatory (road blocked).

description: I was on a business trip in Coventry and had a few hours free in the evening. It's an unusal place. It used to have an intact medieval centre until a heavy German bombing in 1940. In the aftermath, the buildings - including the iconic cathedral - were not reconstructed, but rebuilt in a radical modernist style. There are only two types of architecture in the centre, medieval or concrete and glass, and the contrast is striking.
